This is a static page and not fully functional - the shop page has limited access due to the designers requirements but can be accessed by entering /ShopPage/* in the search bar. All accounts are filled with dummy data for the order history and whishlist section, again, due to designers requirements.
The ARKX page allows a user to take a test in order to discover their arcehtypes. These results are then used to present to the user a personalised product selection where they can browse their personalised items. The page has an "Archetypal Stories" section where the various archetypes are showcased as well as featured products the designers recommend. The page also contains two articles on different designers as well some of their products. The user can see their archetypes in the profile section and a description each identity.
